comments: "This is a major patch after the first release that hopes to flush out the app for week 1!"
additions:
  - Added button to record information on whether or not the scouted team uses Lobbing as a strategy during the match.
  - Added a Show Scroll bar setting which can be used to toggle the visibility of the scroll bar
  - Made it so that most enums for some scouting data are first set to "unset"
fixes:
  - Crushed a major bug where the scouting form's scroll will cull and not persist states
  - Fixed typos throughout the app
  - Removed unworthy theme Lemon Berry & Lost
  - Made it so that multi select and single select will not request keyboard focus when tapped outside of the dropdown arrow
  - Made the canonical team switch actually be readable on certain themes like crimson where the red messed with the foreground color
  - Changed the animation of the canonical team switch to use fade transition instead of a slide transition
  - Removed some useless/unnecessary scouting fields
optimize:
  - Optimized rendering of most scroll views in the app
  - Optimized rigid grid rendering of past matches when using alt. layout
